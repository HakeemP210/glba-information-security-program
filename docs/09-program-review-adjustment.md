# Program Review & Adjustment — 16 CFR §314.4(g)

[← Back to README](../README.md)

## Requirement

§314.4(g) requires the institution to evaluate and adjust its Information Security Program in light of testing/monitoring results, material changes to operations or business arrangements, new risk assessment findings, or any other circumstance that may have a material impact on the program. It's the requirement that turns everything else in this repo from a set of documents produced once into a program that's actually maintained.

## Approach

The program gets reviewed on two tracks:

- **Scheduled** — a full review of every document in this repo at least annually, timed to precede the board/owner report (see [Board Reporting](10-board-reporting.md))
- **Triggered** — an immediate review of the affected document(s) whenever a specific event occurs: a testing/monitoring result, a security incident, a material operational or vendor change, a new or re-scored risk finding, or any other circumstance the Qualified Individual has reason to know may matter

Every review, scheduled or triggered, gets logged in a running **Program Change Log**: date, trigger, what changed, which documents were affected. The point of the log isn't bureaucratic box-checking, it's what lets anyone (an auditor, a reviewer, a future version of me) verify that "the program gets reviewed and adjusted" is an actual practice and not just a sentence in a policy document.

### Incident Response Plan in Use

The clearest example of a triggered review in this program is documented in detail in [Incident Response Plan](06-incident-response-plan.md#its-been-tested-once-for-real): a real security incident, surfaced partway through a scheduled annual review, resulted in a new risk register entry, two existing risk ratings raised to reflect confirmed real-world precedent, a correction to that year's board report, and a confirmed update to the plan's external reporting contact. All of which happened in the same review cycle, all logged.

A second, equally real example: completing the [service provider contract review](07-service-provider-oversight.md) across three separate vendors produced three separate log entries over two weeks, not one. Each contract came back with a different finding, and each finding moved the risk register in a different direction (one risk downgraded, one raised). The log entries above show exactly that.

## Why this matters

A risk assessment that gets written once and never revisited is a snapshot, not a working program. It becomes irrelevant the moment anything changes, which for a real institution is constantly (new vendors, new systems, staff turnover, an actual incident). Naming the specific triggers in advance, rather than leaving "review the program periodically", is what makes this requirement checkable. Either a real event happened and the log shows a corresponding review, or it didn't.
